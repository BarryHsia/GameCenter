# Seedream Image Generation

Generate AI images using ByteDance Seedream 4.5. Use when you need to: (1) create images from text descriptions, (2) generate project engineering architecture diagrams, (3) generate sequence diagrams, or (4) other scenarios where images may be needed to enhance presentation.

## text-->img
Generate an image solely based on text descriptions, referring to {baseDir}/references/text2img.md.


> The generated images need to be downloaded and saved uniformly into the "seedream-generate" folder.
